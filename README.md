Carbonable Indexer
===

At carbonable we have a strong opinion about blockchain and event sourcing. There is obviously a pattern. With this repository we try to solve and address how blockchain can be used as an event store and therefore compose a mix of web2 + web3  applications focused on provable core business logic powered by *cairo* and fast and decoupled services serving data to the outside world.

Features :
- 

- [x] Syncing starknet
- [x] Storing events
- [ ] Architecture & roadmap article
- [ ] Streaming events through message bus
- [ ] Registering applications
- [ ] RPC forwarding (using [nori](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/nori))

Roadmap :
-
For the moment this indexer is only partially used at Carbonable and only powers our leaderboard.

1. Use this indexer for all of our application stack
2. Implement message bus dispatcher
3. One click / command line deployment
